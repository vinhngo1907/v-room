Model for multi-label prediction of [toxic comments](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge?datasetId=1709138), these may be toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import utils
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Embedding, MaxPooling1D, Dropout, LSTM, Bidirectional, SpatialDropout1D, TextVectorization
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
```

Train data contain text and labels with answers.

```python
train_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv',index_col='id')
train_data.head()
```

We need to found which length of message we will analyse for prediction

```python
train_data['comment_length'] = train_data['comment_text'].apply(lambda row: len(row))
train_data.head()
```

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(
    data=train_data,
    x="comment_length",
    hue='toxic',
    multiple="stack",
)
```

![Comment length](../../docs/img/toxic/comment_length.png)

Length of toxic comments: max 5000, min 8, mean 295.24604420034, median 123.0, 75% 271.0.

```python
print(
    'max', toxic_data['comment_length'].max(),
    'min', toxic_data['comment_length'].min(),
    'mean', toxic_data['comment_length'].mean(),
    'median', toxic_data['comment_length'].median(),
    '75%', toxic_data['comment_length'].quantile(0.75),
)
```

So 300 symbols should be enough.

```python
max_comment_len = 300
```

Test data contain two files with text and labels separately.

```python
test_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test.csv',index_col='id')
test_data.head()
```

```python
test_labels_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test_labels.csv',index_col='id')
test_labels_data.head()
```

And some labels has value of -1, that indicates it was not used for scoring; (Note: file added after competition close!)

```python
test_data = test_data.join(test_labels_data)
test_data = test_data[test_data['toxic'] != -1]
test_data.head()
```

I used in [my notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/igordubinin/toxic-comments) solution from "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge" on base of RNN, which takes [3rd place](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52644).

Neural networks this is a series of algorithms that seek to identify relationships in a data without being explicitly programmed.

Neural networks works with numbers, so we need convert messages to numbers.

TextVectorization - A preprocessing layer which maps text features to integer sequences.

max_tokens - Maximum size of the vocabulary for this layer.

adapt - Computes a vocabulary of string terms from tokens in a dataset.

encoder - this is vocabulary created on base of training messages, this is first layer of network that convert coming messages into list of numbers.

Embeding - turns positive integers (indexes) into dense vectors of fixed size. Dense vectors this is modern kind of representing words as vector, this solution have famose effect: King - Man + Woman = Queen.

SpatialDropout1D - dropout, however, it drops entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. Dropout removes some neurons from network, this solution help to avoid overfitting.

LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory layer, this is kind of Recurrent Neural Network. return_sequences - whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence.

Dense - densely-connected NN layer. Final layer that contain 6 neurons with result.

```python
num_words = 10000
encoder = TextVectorization(max_tokens=num_words)
encoder.adapt(train_data['comment_text'].values)

model_lstm = Sequential([
    encoder,
    Embedding(
        input_dim=len(encoder.get_vocabulary()),
        output_dim=128,
        mask_zero=True,
        input_length=max_comment_len,
    ),
    SpatialDropout1D(0.5),
    LSTM(40, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(40),
    Dense(6, activation='sigmoid'),
])
```

Training of neural network this is a process which reduce difference between correct result and result of neural network. NN reduce error by [gradient descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/gradient-descent).

Loss function - a mesure for difference between real and prediction values. There are different [loss functions](https://kitchell.github.io/DeepLearningTutorial/7lossfunctionsoptimizers.html):
binary crossentropy,
categorical crossentropy,
mean squared error.

Gradient descent have [different optimizations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimization-techniques-for-gradient-descent/):
SGD,
Adam,
Momentum,
AdaGrad.

```python
model_lstm.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy', 'AUC'])
```

[ModelCheckpoint](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/model_checkpoint/) callback is used in conjunction with training using model.fit() to save a model or weights (in a checkpoint file) at some interval, so the model or weights can be loaded later to continue the training from the state saved.

```python
model_lstm_save_path = '/kaggle/working/toxic_model_lstm'
checkpoint_callback_lstm = ModelCheckpoint(
    model_lstm_save_path,
    monitor='val_accuracy',
    save_best_only=True,
    verbose=1,
    save_format='tf',
)
```

Get data for training

```python
x_train = train_data['comment_text'].values
y_train = train_data[['toxic', 'severe_toxic', 'obscene', 'threat', 'insult', 'identity_hate']].values
```

Fit of the model

```python
history_lstm = model_lstm.fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    epochs=5, # 15
    batch_size=512,
    validation_split=0.2,
    callbacks=[checkpoint_callback_lstm],
)
```

Result of training

```python
plt.plot(history_lstm.history['accuracy'],
         label='Training accuracy')
plt.plot(history_lstm.history['val_accuracy'],
         label='Validation accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![Accuracy](../../docs/img/toxic/accuracy.png)

Get data for testing

```python
x_test = test_data['comment_text'].values
y_test = test_data[['toxic', 'severe_toxic', 'obscene', 'threat', 'insult', 'identity_hate']].values
```

Check result

```python
model_lstm.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=1)
```

Check result of saved model

```python
saved_model = load_model(model_lstm_save_path)
saved_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=1)
```

Compress model

```
!zip -r /kaggle/working/toxic_model_lstm.zip /kaggle/working/toxic_model_lstm
```

Check model with production data

```python
quotes = [
    "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.",
    "No, no. This kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin… Love, Harry. Love.",
    "I would trust Hagrid with my own life.",
    "Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.",
    "It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices.",
]
not_toxic_prediction = saved_model.predict(quotes)
for labels in not_toxic_prediction:
    print([ round(lbl, 2) for lbl in labels])
```

```python
quotes = [
    "Maybe If The Fat Lump Had Given This A Squeeze, He'd Have Remembered To Fall On His Fat Ass.",
    "No One Asked Your Opinion, You Filthy Little Mudblood.",
    "Didn't Mummy Ever Tell You It Was Rude To Eavesdrop, Potter? Oh, Yeah. She Was Dead Before You Could Wipe The Drool Off Your Chin.",
    "You're Gonna Regret This! You And Your Bloody Chicken!",
    "I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you.",
]
toxic_prediction = saved_model.predict(quotes)
for labels in toxic_prediction:
    print([ round(lbl, 2) for lbl in labels])
```
